### Common Methods of Cybersecurity Attacks

1. #### Phishing

* Phishing involves using digital communications, such as emails or messages, to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information or installing malicious software.
* **Types**:
  - **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: 
    - A threat actor sends an email that appears to be from a trusted source, often requesting sensitive information or financial transactions.
    - This method exploits the trust established in business communications.
  - **Spear Phishing**: 
    - A targeted email attack directed at a specific individual or group.
    - The email is crafted to look like it comes from a trusted source, increasing the likelihood of success.
  - **Whaling**: 
    - A specialized form of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals, such as executives or key decision-makers.
    - The goal is to gain access to sensitive corporate data or financial information.
  - **Vishing**: 
    - Voice phishing that uses phone calls to trick individuals into providing sensitive information.
    - Threat actors may impersonate legitimate organizations to gain trust.
  - **Smishing**: 
    - SMS phishing that uses text messages to deceive users into revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links.

2. #### Malware

- Malware is software specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks.
- **Types**:
  - **Viruses**: 
    - Malicious code that attaches itself to legitimate files and requires user action (e.g., opening an infected file) to spread.
    - Once activated, it can corrupt or delete data and spread to other files.
  - **Worms**: 
    - A type of malware that can replicate itself and spread across networks without user intervention.
    - Worms exploit vulnerabilities in software or operating systems to propagate.
  - **Ransomware**: 
    - A malicious attack that encrypts an organizationâ€™s data, rendering it inaccessible until a ransom is paid.
    - This type of attack can cause significant operational disruption and financial loss.
  - **Spyware**: 
    - Software that secretly gathers user information without consent, often used to collect personal data such as passwords, credit card numbers, and browsing habits.
    - Spyware can also monitor user activity and send the collected data to the attacker.

3. #### Social Engineering

- Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human psychology to gain confidential information, access, or valuables.
- **Common Types**:
  - **Social Media Phishing**: 
    - Threat actors gather detailed information about targets from social media platforms to craft personalized attacks.
    - This information is used to create convincing messages that trick users into providing sensitive data.
  - **Watering Hole Attack**: 
    - An attack that targets a specific group by compromising a website they frequently visit.
    - Once the site is infected, visitors may unknowingly download malware.
  - **USB Baiting**: 
    - A tactic where infected USB drives are left in public places, hoping that someone will plug them into their computer, thus infecting the network.
  - **Physical Social Engineering**: 
    - Involves impersonating employees, customers, or vendors to gain unauthorized access to physical locations, such as offices or data centers.

* #### Principles of Social Engineering

 1. **Authority**: 
    - Threat actors impersonate individuals with power or authority, exploiting the natural tendency of people to comply with requests from perceived authority figures.
 2. **Intimidation**: 
    - Using threats or aggressive tactics to persuade victims to comply with requests, often creating a sense of fear or urgency.
 3. **Consensus/Social Proof**: 
    - Leveraging the idea that if others are doing something, it must be legitimate, thus convincing victims to follow suit.
 4. **Scarcity**: 
    - Creating a false sense of urgency by implying that a product or service is in limited supply, prompting quick action without careful consideration.
 5. **Familiarity**: 
    - Establishing a false emotional connection with the target, making them more likely to trust the attacker.
 6. **Trust**: 
    - Building a relationship over time to gain personal information, often through repeated interactions that seem benign.
 7. **Urgency**: 
    - Encouraging rapid responses to requests, often without allowing time for critical thinking or verification.
